Normalmente, são características que descrevem um objeto. Elas precisam ser tratadas antes de serem aplicadas nos algoritmos de ML pois os modelos só conseguem trabalhar com números (por vezes, os dados estão em variáveis categóricas). A utilização de features desnecessárias ou mal-tratadas aumenta o custo computacional do modelo, de seu treinamento, tempo de treinamento e pode até atrapalhar seu desempenho final."],"metadata":{"id":"FNQRmtgLFk8L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["b.

Ou seja, ocorre antes mesmo de iniciarmos o treinamento do modelo e de acordo com os critérios que explicitamos, como o número limite de features ou o limite estatístico que determinamos.\n","Os métodos de Wrapper são métodos de tentativa-e-erro: eles dividem o total de features em subconjuntos e realizam testes para tentar encontrar o subconjunto que produz os modelos com as melhores previsões.\n","Por fim, os métodos de embedding ocorrem DURANTE o treinamento do modelo. É algo inerente ao processo de aprendizagem de máquina, onde o melhor subconjunto de features é selecionado como consequência do processo de treinamento. Como exemplo, temos as árvores de decisão."],"metadata":{"id":"hcqUAWbHHgxV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["c. Explique com suas palavras o que são escalares, vetores e espaços vetoriais.

Estes, por sua vez, quando agrupados, ocupam um espaço - este é chamado de espaço vetorial. Por exemplo, no breast cancer dataset temos uma coluna de 'radius_mean'. Cada uma das instâncias numéricas é um escalar, enquanto a coluna inteira, com todas as suas instâncias, vai corresponder a um vetor.

Entretanto, se estiver perguntando em respeito a aplicar o MinMax Scaler e o Standard Scaler, por exemplo, ao mesmo conjunto de dados, a resposta continua sendo não. O StandardScaler mexe com os valores de forma com que a média deles seja 0 e a variância seja 1, controlando o espalhamento dos dados. Entretanto, para isso, não tem controle sobre os valores máximo e mínimo. Já o MinMax Scaler faz justamente o contrário: ele mexe com os valores de forma com que todos fiquem dentro de uma faixa de valores (normalmente de 0 a 1), mantendo a proporção dos dados e a sua distribuição de probabilidades. Dessa forma, não tem como termos controle sobre a média e variância dos dados. Por isso não dá para aplicarmos os métodos simultaneamente; eles são contraprodutivos."],"metadata":{"id":"x3fip57NTMjE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5) Considere o Large Movie Review

Além disso, também pode auxiliar na remoção de correlações entre as features que possam ter passado intactas durante o PCA.
